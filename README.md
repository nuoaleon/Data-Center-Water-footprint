# Data-Center-Water-footprint

# Scope
* A simple tool for simultaneous data center *Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)* and *Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)* prediction
* Physics-based model supporting *facility-level* and *national-level* analysis

# How to use
Please see the simple demonstration in "demo.ipynb"

# Inputs
1. Climate condition
2. Data center system parameters (equipment specifications, system operational efficiency metrics, and indoor environment set points)
